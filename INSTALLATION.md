# Installation and Usage Guide â€“ Bike Trip Data Analysis

This guide will help you set up the project, install dependencies, and run the analysis scripts.

# Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or later). You will also need to install the required Python packages.

# Setup Steps

* Create or download this repository to your local machine.
* Install required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the Data Analysis Scripts

Run the following scripts to perform data analysis on bike trip data:

- Analyze daily bike trip data:
  ```bash
  python analyze_bike_data.py
  ```
  This script loads, processes, and visualizes daily bike trips.

- Detect monthly peak bike trip days:
  ```bash
  python detect_monthly_peaks.py
  ```
  This script identifies the peak bike trip day for each month and saves the results in `monthly_peak_trips.csv`.

# Interpreting the Output

- `monthly_peak_trips.csv` will contain each month's peak bike trip day and the number of trips recorded.
- The generated visualizations will show daily bike trips with monthly peaks highlighted for easy interpretation.

The Bike Trip Data Analysis is now ready to use.
